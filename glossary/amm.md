## What

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a type of protocols that allow people to trade their coins on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) without relying on intermediares. They use mathematical functions that make it possible for people to trade their assets (coins) with one another in a transparent way on the blockchain. They are a replacement for the matching engine used on traditional marketplaces, instead of order books (used on centralized exchanges) they use Liquidity Pools (a collection of tokens/coins that people can trade against at any time)

## Why

Traditional digital markets, like the NASDAQ stock exchange (as well as centralized crypto exchanges, such as Binance or Coinbase) work with matching engines built for what we call Limit Order Books: buyers and sellers have to offer up their goods at a certain price in a certain quantity, and wait to be matched with someone else to conduct a trade. This may sound simple in principle, but these orderbooks are a very competitive landscape where professional market makers compete with each other at split second speeds — it has been practically impossible to replicate this model on today's decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum.

Instead, AMMs use Liquidity Pools and mathematical functions (usually in the form of y=x*k) to allow people to trade 24/7 without an intermediary. These trades are served by autoamted robots that can't deviate from their design

## Risk

There are various risks involved with using AMMS. These include but are not limited to:
* Protocol Risk - risk due to mechanics in the design of a protocol. Even when the protocol functions as intended there might be risks e.g. high slippage incurred in trades due to the liquidity curve set-up
* Smart contract risk - This is risk from an error in the code causing the contract to operate in ways unexpected by the developers. It might leave the code vulnerable to exploits or other attacks
* Cybersecurity risk - Hackers, Exploiters or other malicious actors trying to attack Uniswap
* Scam coins / rugpulls — the market owner on e.g. coinbase makes sure only "legit" coins are available on their platform; not the case on permissionless DEXes

## Reward

* Decentralization - You can perform an exchange without the need for trusted intermediaries
* Incentive Rewards - Sometimes the DEX protocols have their own coin which they give out as a reward to their users (as an airdrop or in form of yield for providing liquidity, for example). These coins get their value from governing future changes to the protocol they are connected to, typically.
* Non-custodial - You can interact with AMMS directly from your crypto wallets, while retaining full custodianship of your assets. All transactions are done via smart contracts, all form the comfort of your wallet
