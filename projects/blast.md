Blast is a unique Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) platform that offers native yield for ETH and stablecoins, such as its own USDB. The yields are generated from ETH staking and Real-World Asset (RWA) protocols, which are then automatically passed back to users. This L2 is designed from scratch to incorporate these yields natively, making it EVM-compatible and an optimistic rollup. It introduces a higher baseline yield for users and developers, creating opportunities for new Dapp business models not possible on other L2s.
