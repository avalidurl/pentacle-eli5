Phaver is a social platform aiming to revolutionize online social graphs by allowing users to own and build them, rather than corporations. It leverages blockchain technology, specifically integrating with Lens Protocol and CyberConnect among others, to enable a decentralized social experience. 

Phaver offers features like multi-protocol support for bringing your own socials on-chain, gamified elements to build credibility and earn unique perks, and rewarding contributions with Phaver Points and future token rewards. The platform emphasizes openness, with easy sign-up processes and no whitelists, promoting a more inclusive Web3 social experience.
