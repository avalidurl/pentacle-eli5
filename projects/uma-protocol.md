UMA, or Universal Market Access, is a decentralized financial contracts platform built on Ethereum. It enables users to create custom synthetic assets, which are blockchain-based contracts that can track the price of virtually anything. UMA focuses on allowing parties to write self-enforcing smart contracts with economic guarantees, using its unique "priceless" contract design that minimizes the need for on-chain price feeds. It aims to democratize and decentralize the financial derivatives market, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.
